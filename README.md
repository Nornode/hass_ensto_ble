## Features

### Heating Mode

Configure the thermostat's heating mode.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & services → [Your thermostat]**
2. Find the **Heating mode** selector
3. Select a mode from the dropdown menu

**Available modes** (not all thermostats support all modes):
- **Floor** – Floor sensor based heating (ECO16 only)
- **Room** – Room sensor based heating
- **Combination** – Combined floor and room sensors (ECO16 only)
- **Power** – Direct power control

> **Note:** Floor temperature min/max values are only used in Combination mode. Boost power offset and vacation power offset are only used in Power mode.

### Boost Mode

Temporarily increase the temperature for a specified duration.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & services → [Your thermostat]**
2. Configure the following:
   - **Boost duration** – Duration in minutes
   - **Boost temperature offset** – Offset from -20°C to +20°C (or **Boost power offset** from -100% to +100% in Power mode)
3. Enable the **Boost mode** switch
4. The **Boost remaining** sensor shows the countdown to zero, then automatically disables

### Adaptive Temperature Control

Enable the thermostat's built-in adaptive temperature adjustment.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & services → [Your thermostat]**
2. Find the **Adaptive temperature control** switch
3. Toggle on or off as needed

### Daylight Saving

Configure automatic daylight saving time adjustments.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & services → [Your thermostat]**
2. Find the **Daylight saving** switch
3. Toggle on or off as needed

The device automatically converts between UTC and local time based on this setting.

### Device Time Synchronization

Synchronize the thermostat's internal clock with Home Assistant.

- **Automatic synchronization:** The integration automatically monitors the thermostat's clock against Home Assistant UTC time. If the device drifts by more than 1 minute, the integration automatically synchronizes the date, time, and daylight saving offsets in the background (rate-limited to once every 24 hours).
- **Manual synchronization:** You can also trigger an immediate synchronization at any time:
  1. Navigate to **Developer Tools → Actions**
  2. Select service `hass_ensto_ble.set_device_time`
  3. Select your thermostat's DateTime entity as target
  4. Click **Perform action**
  5. Verify the **Date and time** sensor shows the correct local time

> **Note:** Time is handled internally in UTC to ensure consistent operation across time zones.

### Bluetooth Adapter Selection & Fault Tolerance

Ensure dependable connectivity in setups with multiple Bluetooth adapters or ESPHome Bluetooth proxies.

- **Adapter Binding or Auto-Selection:** During initial setup, choose a specific Bluetooth adapter/proxy or allow the integration to automatically select the adapter with the strongest signal (highest RSSI).
- **Automatic Failover:** If the preferred adapter experiences consecutive connection failures, the integration temporarily falls back to the best available alternative adapter for 10 minutes before re-testing.
- **ESPHome Proxy Tolerance:** Added retry logic for initial GATT characteristic discovery, allowing ESPHome Bluetooth proxies ample time to complete service resolution.
- **Circuit Breaker & Backoff:** Transient disconnects trigger incremental retries. After repeated failures, the device enters a brief 2-minute cooldown rather than exhausting Bluetooth bandwidth with rapid reconnections.
- **Authentication Recovery:** If pairing state becomes desynchronized (`AuthenticationFailed`), the integration automatically unpairs and re-initiates pairing.

### Floor Sensor Type

Change the floor sensor type for accurate temperature readings (ECO16 only).

1. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & services → [Your thermostat]**
2. Find the **Floor sensor type** selector

## Troubleshooting

### Pairing Issues

Some users need additional pairing via terminal to establish a Bluetooth connection.

1. Open the Home Assistant terminal
2. Run `bluetoothctl` (you can continue entering commands while Bluetooth messages appear)
3. If you previously added the thermostat and then paired it to another device, first run:
   ```
   remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   ```
4. Run the following commands (replace XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX with your device's MAC address):
   ```
   trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   ```
5. Set your Ensto thermostat to pairing mode (blue LED blinking)
6. Proceed with adding the thermostat in Home Assistant

### Time Sync Issues

Incorrect internal time (e.g., years in the future or past) is commonly caused by a weak or dead RTC backup battery.

1. Replace the CR1225 battery (see device installation manual)
2. Use the `set_device_time` service in Developer Tools to synchronize the time immediately (or wait for the integration's automatic background synchronization to take effect)

## Known Limitations

### Device Name Writing (Home Assistant OS 16.2+)

Device names cannot be changed via Home Assistant on systems using BlueZ 5.82 or newer (Home Assistant OS 16.2+).

**Cause:** BlueZ 5.82+ enforces strict Bluetooth standards and blocks client-side writes to GAP (Generic Access Profile) characteristics, including UUID 2A00 (Device Name).

**Workaround:** Use Ensto's official mobile application (iOS/Android) to change the device name. The integration reads and displays the device name in Home Assistant.
